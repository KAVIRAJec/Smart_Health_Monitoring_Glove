# Smart_Health_Monitoring_Glove

##Idea Of the Project:
* The proposed idea is to develop hand glove which is used to measure oxygen level and heart beat in non-invasive manner.
* The hand glove will be connected to the IoT platform which helps doctors to monitor the patient regularly without any physical contact.
* The smart watch which are already available in market to measure the parameters are highly expensive which can be replaced by this simple hand glove embedded with low cost sensors.

##Technology Used:
*  The hand glove which, equipped with sensors are respectively connected to the controller which can detect the oxygen level, temperature,Flex value and heart beat 
*  The IoT platform is used to interact between patient and doctors by our own IoT server(xampp webpage)
*  To develop a web page that displays all the parameters, if any of the parameter is abnormal, a message or call with be send to the respective doctor and patient.
*  It would be uses as a medicine reminder ,so that the patient never forget to take medicine(tablet) on time.

##Benefits:
It reduces the time which we spend for regular check up.
It would be used as a self monitoring gadget , from which we could note regular graphical data or day to day improvement from injury or bone fracture.
