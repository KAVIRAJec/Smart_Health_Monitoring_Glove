# Smart_Health_Monitoring_Glove
in this project we developed a smart glove by using this we can measure pulse level, oxygen level and temperature. for this we have used a sensor called pulse oximeter. we have used another sensor  called flex sensor which can be monitor day to day improvement from a injury or bone crack.And also we used RTC module which can displays the time,by keeping sertain time as alarm ,it is used as medicine remainder. The above said information are self monitor and pushed to IoT cloud by this IoT anyone(doctor or anyone) can monitor . it would be very useful
